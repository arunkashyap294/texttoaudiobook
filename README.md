This program can be used to convert text input like a PDF File, Word document or a URL to an MP3 audio file. 
The purpose/inspiration of this tool is to convert those files/books which are not available on Amazon Audible to convert those to MP3 format so that it can be listened to. 
For example, the Berkshire Letters from 1977 to 2024 are not available on Audible and that was the primary inspiration to come up with this tool. This tool has an option to convert Berkshire letters to audio format.
There are 3 options which are present.
1) Convert Berkshire Letter to MP3 format - You can convert multiple years PDF to a single MP3 format.
2) Upload a PDF to convert to MP3 format.
